# todo list.

this is a simple flutter project that has a static todo list when first gets compiled.
but you can add or delete other todo lists.
you can checka todo list if you finished it and click on saved to save or cancel to bring it back to normal.
you hold to delete and tab to check/uncheck.

i hope you like it  <3
